# House Price Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting house prices using various machine learning models. 
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, 
and building machine learning models like Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict the `SalePrice` of houses based on several features.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the raw dataset files.
  - `train.csv`: The training dataset for house prices.
  - `test.csv`: The test dataset for house prices (if applicable).

- **code/**: The source code directory.
  - `datavisualization.py`: Contains all the graphs, statstics that are used for analysis and understanding of the data.
  - `model.py`: Contains functions for training and evaluating machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest.

- **distributions_pre.pdf**: A PDF file that contains visualizations of feature distributions before preprocessing.
- **distributions_post.pdf**: A PDF file that contains visualizations of feature distributions after preprocessing.

- **data_description.txt**: A file that explains the different predictor variables.  
- **README.md**: This file.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required for running the code:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `seaborn`: For advanced visualizations.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models and evaluation.
- `scipy`: For advanced scientific functions.
  
You can install the required libraries using `pip`:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy

To run the file. run the model.py file.
